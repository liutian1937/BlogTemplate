We're excited to see how the Open Data Policy evolves with the input of the community, and we hope this is just the first of many.</p>  <p>By choosing <a href='http://pages.github.com'>GitHub Pages</a>, government employees as well as citizens are empowered to continuously propose and discuss potential improvements, creating a living policy document to 'unlock the potential of government data'.</p>  <p>Civic hackers and public servants at all levels are using GitHub to collaborate on everything from <a href='https://github.com/unitedstates/congress-legislators/blob/master/executive.yaml'>information about elected officials</a> to <a href='https://github.com/Chicago/osd-bike-routes'>the location of the nearest bike rack</a>.
